CIFAR-10 Dataset

Overview
CIFAR-10 is a widely used dataset for machine learning and computer vision tasks. It consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The dataset is split into 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images.

Classes:- The dataset contains the following classes:

Airplane
Automobile
Bird
Cat
Deer
Dog
Frog
Horse
Ship
Truck

Usage
CIFAR-10 is often used for tasks such as image classification, object recognition, and image segmentation. It serves as a benchmark dataset for evaluating the performance of machine learning and deep learning algorithms in computer vision tasks.

Data Format
Each image in the CIFAR-10 dataset is a 32x32 RGB image, meaning it has 3 color channels (Red, Green, and Blue). The pixel values are stored in the range of 0 to 255 for each color channel.

License
The CIFAR-10 dataset is freely available for research purposes. It was collected by Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton at the University of Toronto. For more information about the dataset and its usage policies, please refer to the CIFAR website: CIFAR website.
